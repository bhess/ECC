\section{Introduction}
An \emph{Elliptic Curve} can be roughly described as the set of solutions to an equation of the form $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ over some field (e.g. $\mathbb{C}, 
\mathbb{R},\mathbb{Q}$ or some finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$). The importence of elliptic curves stems from their rich structure: there is a rather simple
addition law definable on elliptic curves which makes them into an abelian group. Studying the emerging structure of elliptic curves over various fields has been a
major theme in the mathematics of the 20th centaury, and elliptic curves were connected to many famous problems and results, most notably the proof of Fermat's
last theorem\marginpar{Give some reference, to a good survey if possible}.

In the late 70's, \emph{Public-Key Cryptography} systems were first publicly described, changing the face of cryptography. Many of the purposed systems, such
as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange system and the ElGamal encryption system\marginpar{Reference to both papers}, were based on arithmetic in the group $\mathbb{Z}_p$, but in theory could
be implemented in other groups as well. Groups based on elliptic curves were a good choice because of their well-developed theory and their high variety. In 1985,
both Neal Koblitz and Victor S. Miller \marginpar{Ref...} suggested public key cryptosystems based on elliptic curves.

Our goal in the project has been to implement an efficient public key cryptosystem based on elliptic curves ``from scratch'', relying only on large-number arithmetic
libraries. In particular, we have implemented all the elliptic-curve related calculations, and additional related algorithms.

\section{Elliptic Curves}
\subsection{Definition}
Most generally, and elliptic curve $E$ over a field $K$ can be described as the subset of $K\times K$ satisfying the equation $$y^2+a_1xy+a_3y=x^3+a_2x^2+a_4x+a_6$$ 
for a given $a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6\in K$, along with another special point ``at infinity'' $\mathcal{O}$. An additional demand is that the curve be ``smooth'',
which means that the partial derivatives of the curve has no common zeros. This can be reduced to checking that some invariant value $\Delta$ (the \emph{discriminant} of the curve)
which is calculated from the coefficients is not zero\marginpar{Add a picture}. Because the nature of the field $K$ is highly relevant to the structure of $E$,
it is common to write $E/K$ indicating the curve $E$ (usually given by the equation) iis defined over the field $K$.

Depending on the characteristic of $K$, the above equation can be simplified. There are three cases to consider:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item When $charK\ne 2,3$ the equation can be simplified to $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ with $a,b\in K$.
  \item When $charK = 2$ and $a_1 \ne 0$, the equation can be simplified to $y^2+xy=x^3+ax^2+b$ with $a,b\in K$. This curve is said to be \emph{non-supersingular}. If $a_1 = 0$, the equation can be simplified to $y^2+cy=x^3+ax+b$ with $a,b,c\in K$. This curve is said to be \emph{supersingular}.
  \item When $charK = 3$ and $a_1^2\ne -a_2$, the equation can be simplified to $y^2=x^3+ax^2+b$ with $a,b\in K$. This curve is said to be \emph{non-supersingular}. If $a_1^2=-a_2$, the equation can be simplified to $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ with $a,b\in K$. This curve is said to be \emph{supsersingular}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Motivating Example: $K=\mathbb{C}$}
A \emph{lattice} in the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ is a set of the form $L=\{n\omega_1+m\omega_2|n,m\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ such that $\omega_1,\omega_2\in\mathbb{C}$ are
not colinear. Lattices can be used to generalize the notion of ``periodic function'' to the complex plane: A meromorphic function $f$ is called \emph{elliptic} with respect to the lattice
$L$ if $f(z+l)=f(z)$ for all $l\in L$ (equivalently, $f(z+\omega_1)=f(z+\omega_2)=f(z)$). Thus it suffices to know the values of $f$ of the \emph{fundemental parallelogram} $\Pi=\{a\omega_1+b\omega_2|a,b\in[0,1]\}$
in order to know its values on the complex plane.

In $\mathbb{R}$, the periodic function $\sin(x)$ is ``special'' in the sense that along with its derivative, $\cos(x)$. it can be used to represent all
the periodic functions (via Fourier series). There is a parallel ``special'' function for elliptic functions, which in some regards is ``even better'' than its real counterpart. 
Given a lattice $L$, the \emph{Weierstrass $\wp$-function} for this lattice is defined as $$\wp(z)=\frac{1}{z^2}\sum_{0\ne l\in L}\left(\frac{1}{(z-l)^2}-\frac{1}{l^2}\right)$$
$\wp$ has the property that every elliptic function (in respect to a given lattice $L$) can be written as a \emph{rational} function in $\wp$ and $\wp'$ (as opposed to the
infinite sum of $\sin$ and $\cos$). Thus $\wp$ is the most significant example of an elliptic function.

Let $E/\mathbb{C}$ be an elliptic curve given by $y^2=x^3+ax+b$. A lattice $L$ can be found such that the corresponding Weierstrass function satisfies the differential equation
$(\wp')^2=\wp^3+a\wp+b$. This means that the map $z\mapsto (\wp(z),\wp'(z))$ maps $\mathbb{C}$ to points on the elliptic curve. In particular, $\wp$
has a pole in each lattice point and so $0\mapsto \mathcal{O}$ (this can be made precise by using projective coordinates). Moreover, it
can be shown that this map is onto, and that $z_1,z_2$ give the same point on the curve if and only if $z_1-z_2\in L$, and so we have a bijection
between $E$  and $\mathbb{C}/L$, the latter set can be thought of as a torus (since $\mathbb{C}/L$ is isomorphic to $\Pi$ where parallel edges are ``glued`` together).

Since $\mathbb{C}/L$ can be equipped with an operation of addition modulu $L$, it forms an abelian group. This group structure can thus be induced on the 
isomorphic elliptic curve: Given $P_1, P_2$ on the curve that emerge from $z_1,z_2$ (i.e. $P_i=(\wp(z_i),\wp'(z_i))$) we define $P_1+P_2=(\wp(z_1+z_2),\wp'(z_1+z_2))$ 
(with the addition of $z_1+z_2$ done modulu $L$). This shown that every elliptic curve over $\mathbb{C}$ is an abelian group.
\subsection{The Group Operation}
In the previous section we have seen how eliiptic curves over $\mathbb{C}$ can be naturally induced with a group operation. There is no similar theory over
other fields, but we can still axiomatically define an operation similar to the one arising in the complex case. A detailed analysis of the complex case yields
the following rough description of the group operation:

First, for the special point $\mathcal{O}$ we have $P+\mathcal{O}=\mathcal{O}+P=P$, so $\mathcal{O}$ is the identity element.

Second, $(x,y)+(x,-y)=\mathcal{O}$ (note that if $(x,y)\in E$ so is $(x,-y)$ since the in equation defining $E$ is of the form $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ and so for
every $x$ we have two possible values of $y$, given that $x^3+ax+b$ has roots at all). So given a point $P$, its additive inverse $-P$ is simply the same point
with the sign of the y-coordinate flipped.

Third, for every three colinear points on the curve $P,Q,R$ we have $P+Q+R=0$, and so $P+Q=-R$. We can picture this in the following manner: Given $P,Q$,
to compute their sum draw a line passing through them, and find the third point where the line crosses the curve (there is always such one - if it seems the line 
''misses`` the curve, it actaully intersects it in $\mathcal{O}$; again, using projective coordinates this can be made precise). After such a point was found, we
take its inverse to be the result of $P+Q$. This might seem like an arbitrary definition, and so it is worthwhile to remember that it is actually a result of the non-arbitrary
operation induced in $\mathbb{C}$.

We also need to describe what is $P+P$. In this case we cannot pass a single line ''between $P$ and itself``, but we have a similar notion: Since the curve is smooth,
it has exactly one tangent line in each point. Therefore we have that $P+P$ is the additive inverse of the point of intersection with the curve of the tangent line to the curve at $P$.

This completes the description of the group operation. Although it arises from the complex case, this description is valid over any field, and can be taken to be
the definition of the group action. In is a straightforward technical manner to check that the axioms for group operation are indeed satisfied by this operation.

The geometrical description of the operation is insightful but of little use in algebraic calculations. However, straightforward analytic geometry
gives simple equations for calculating addition of points. The actual equations depends on the simplified form of the curve; we will focus later on the cases
where $charK\ne 2,3$ and $charK=2$ as these are the main cases used in practice.

\subsection{Group Structure}
The structure of the group of an elliptic curve highly depends on the underlying field. For $K=\mathbb{C}$ we have already seen that it has the structure of a torus.
Over $\mathbb{Q}$, a famous theorem of Mordell shows that the group is finitely generated; since it is also abelian, it is of the form $\mathbb{Z}^r\times Z$
where $Z$ (the \emph{torsion} subgroup of the curve) is a finite abelian group. The torsion of an elliptic curve is easy to compute and is very well known -
it is known that there are only 15 possible torsion subgroups, the largest of whom of cardinality 16. The main difficulty is computing the parameter
$r$ - the \emph{rank} of the curve. Of the the most famous open conjectures in mathematics, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, deals
with the connection between the rank of a curve (and various other related parameters) and the behivour of a special function related to the curve (the
zeta-function of that curve).

Over a finite field $K=\mathbb{F}_q$ ($q$ a power of a prime), the order of the curve is, of course, finite. However, it is not easy to know in general
what is the exact number of points on the curve.  A reasonable estimate is given by Hasse's theorem, which shows that the order is roughly $q+1$, with
a square-root bound on the error. More precisely, if $\#E(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the number of points on the curve $E$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, then 
$|\#E(\mathbb{F}_q)-(q+1)|\le 2\sqrt{q}$

Knowing the order of the curve is very important when using curves for cryptographic purposes. There exist algorithms for computing the order, but
they are quite complicated and not very efficient. Thus, sometimes a different approach is used - first the order is chosen, and then a suitable curve
for that order is generated. We elaborate on this later.
\section{Elliptic Curve Arithmetic}
\subsection{Projective Coordinates}
As we shall see, the usual usage of elliptic curve in cryptosystems is in computing $P+P+\dots+P$ for a given point $P$. 
The formulas for adding points on the curve includes a division operation, which in most implementations is very costly. Therefore, it is reasonable to
transform the coordinate system into one in which no division is needed for the addition operation itself, only for transforming back to the standard
coordinate system once the calculation is complete. Such a coordinate system is the \emph{projective} coordinate system.

Theoretically it is possible to imagine the projective coordinate system as one in which every two-dimensional point is represented by a ray in the three
dimensional space. Formally we consider the set $K^3\\\{(0,0,0)\}$ with an equivalence relation charctarisied by two positive integers $c,d$ and
defined by $(X_1,Y_1,Z_1)\sim (X_2,Y_2,Z_2)$ if $X_1=\lambda^cX_2,Y_1=\lambda^dY_2,Z_1=\lambda Z_2$ for some $\lambda\in K^*$ (for $c=d=1$
indeed we have that each equivalance class is a line in $K^3$).

The two-dimensional point $(X,Y)$ can be identified with the projective point represented by $(X,Y,1)$, and so in general a projective point represented by
$(X,Y,Z)$ with $Z\ne 0$ corresponds to a standard point $(\frac{X}{Z^a},\frac{Y}{Z^b})$. However, projective points represented by $(X,Y,0)$
have no standard two-dimensional equivalent, and so are considered ''points in infinity``. Indeed, this is a way to formally represent $\mathcal{O}$.

\subsection{Addition Formulas - The Prime Field Case}
We consider now the case $K=\mathbb{F}_p$ for $p>3$ prime (however, for any $K$ such that $char K\ne 2,3$ our description is essentially the same).
In this case let $E$ be a curve defined by $y^2=x^3+ax+b$. Given two points on the curve $P=(x_1,y_1),Q=(x_2,y_2)$ we first consider the case $x_1\ne x_2$
(and so $P\ne\pm Q$). The line passing both in $P$ and $Q$ has slope $\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$ and so its equation is $y=y_1+\left(\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\right)(x-x_1)$.

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsection{The Prime Field Case}
\subsubsection{Complex Multiplication}
For $K=\mathbb{F}_p$, $p$ a given large prime, there is a polynomial time algorithm of Schoof for computing the number of points on a given curve.
However, it is quite slow in practice (the basic running time is $O(\log ^8p)$, although improvements were made) and quite complicated to implement.
Therefore we have used a different approach - first we decide on the desired order of the curve and the value of $p$, and afterwards we generate a
curve over $\mathbb{F}_p$ with that order. The method we use is reffered to as the \emph{Complex Multiplication} method. The theory of complex
multiplication is quite deep; we present here a brief overview of the facts related to the method.

Given an elliptic curve $E$ over some field $K$, we consider the set of \emph{endomorphisms} of $E$ (an homomorphism from $E$ to itself). There are
alwys ''trivial`` endomorphisms $\varphi_m$ defined by $\varphi_m(P)=m\cdot P=P+P+\dots+P$, and it's easy to see that endomorphisms form a ring
with induced addition (i.e. $(\varphi+\psi)(P)=\varphi(P)+\psi(P)$) and composition serving as multiplication, and that the ''trivial'' endomprhisms form a subring
isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$. If the curve possess more endomprhisms, it is said to have possess complex multiplication. The name stems from
the fact that in this case the ring of endomorphisms is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}\tau+\mathbb{Z}$ with $\tau = (D+\sqrt{D})/2$ for some $D<0$
such that $D\equiv 0,1 (\mathrm{mod }4)$, i.e. the ring of endomorphisms is contained in a quadratic imaginary field. The value $D$ is called the \emph{discriminant} of the
endomprhisms ring, and the isomorphic ring is denoted by $\mathcal{O}_D$.

The usefulness of complex multiplication for our goals comes from the following fact: if $E$ is an elliptic curve possessing complex multiplication over $\mathbb{Q}$
with discriminant $D$, we can effectively calculate the order of $E$ over almost any field $\mathbb{F}_p$, problems arising only in cases where $p$ divides $D$ or
when the equation of $E$ does not define a proper ellitpic curve over $\mathbb{F}_p$ (because the curve is not smooth). These cases are rare and
pose no real problem.

Recall that the order of any curve over $\mathbb{F}_p$ is $p+1+a_p$, with $|a_p|\le2\sqrt{p}$, so the challange lies in computing $a_p$. If $D$ is
a quadratic residue over $p$, we have $a_p=\pi+\overline{\pi}$, with $\pi$ being an element of $\mathcal{O}_D$ such that $\pi\overline{\pi}=p$.
$\pi$ can be denoted $\frac{a+b\sqrt{D}}{2}$ , and so $\overline{\pi}=\frac{a-b\sqrt{D}}{2}$ (recall that $D<0$ so $\sqrt{D}$ is imaginary),
and so $p=\pi\overline{\pi}=\frac{a^2+|D|b^2}{4}$, or $4p=a^2+|D|b^2$, and  $a_p=\pi+\overline{\pi}=\frac{a+b\sqrt{D}+(a-b\sqrt{D}}{2}=a$.

Hence, if $D$ and $p$ are already known, to compute the order of the curve one needs only to solve the equation $a^2+|D|b^2=4p$. However, this equation
has two solutions (for $a$) which differ by sign, and so we get two different candidates for the order of the curve. A prectical solution to this problem, which
we have implemented, is to take a random point $P$ on the curve and raise it to the power of each of the candidates, expecting to get $\mathcal{O}$ only
once. This proved to be an efficient and reliable solution.

Two questions remain: First, how to solve the equation $a^2+b^2|D|=4p$; and second, how to find a curve $E$ possing complex multiplication for
a given $D$?

\subsubsection{Cornacchia's Algorithm}
The first problem touches upon a well-known problem in mathematics - when is there a solution to the equation $x^2+ny^2=p$ with $p$ prime and
$n$ a natural number, and how can such a solution be found? The origins of the question can be traced to Fermat who gave the complete classification of
$p$ having solution for $n=1,2,3$. The proof of Fermat's results was first given by Euler, and it is connected strongly to the quadratic reciprocity theorem.
The general theory classifying $p$ for an arbitrary $n$ is quite deep and heavily relies on class field theory. However, there is a simple algorithm which
is essenitally based on the Euclidean algorithm which always yields a solution if one exists.

The algorithm, due to Cornacchia, first determines whether $-n$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ and aborts if it is not (if $x^2+ny^2=p$ then $x^2=-ny^2$ modulo $p$,
i.e. $-n=\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^2$ modulo $p$). Next, a square root $x_0$ is found (i.e. $x_0^2=-d$ modulo $p$) - this requires an algorithm for square-root
extension modulo $p$ but in most cases it is quite easy and there is a standard probabilistic algorithm due to Shanks which deals with the only difficult case.
The next step is simply applying the Euclidean algorithm to the pair $(p,x_0)$ until a $b$ is obtained such that $b<\sqrt{p}$, and then the solution to the original equation
is $(x,y)=\left(b,\sqrt{\frac{p-b^2}{n}}\right)$ (if the square root does not exist, it is guaranteed there is no solution to the original equation).

We are dealing with a slightly different equation as on the right-hand side we have $4p$ instead of $p$. However, this requires only a slight change in
the algorithm - if we start the Eulidean algorithm with $(2p,x_0)$ and terminate it as soon as a value lower than $2\sqrt{p}$ is found, it is still guaranteed
to work unless no solution exists.

\subsubsection{The Hilbert Class Polynomials}
We turn now to the question of finding an elliptic curve possessing complex multiplication over $\mathbb{Q}$ for a given discriminant $D$. Given a
curve $E$ defined by the equation $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ its \emph{$j$-invariant} is defined as follows: $j_0=1728\frac{4a^3}{4a^3+27b^2}$ (the
constant 1728 is traditionally used for normalization purposes which we won't describe here). Over $\mathbb{Q}$ the j-invariant is unique for each
isomorphism class of curves; however, over $\mathbb{F}_p$, it is not. It is easy to see that for a curve given by $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ and any $c\in\mathbb{F}^*_p$,
the curve defined by $y^2=x^3+ac^2x+bc^3$ has the same j-invariant, but if $c$ is non-square, the new curve (termed \emph{the twist} of the original curve)
is not isomorphic to the original (if $c$ is a square, we have a new curve that is isomorphic to the original). This is not a real problem, though: recall that we have said that there are two possible candidates for the order of
the generated curve; one of the candidates is the real order of the curve, and the other one is the order of its twist.

Given a $j_0\in\mathbb{F}_p$ value, it is not difficult to construct an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{F}_p$ with $j_0$ as the j-invariant;
indeed, define $k=\frac{j_0}{1728-j_0}$, and define $E$ by the equation $y^2=x^3+3kx+2k$. Now, by direct computation of the j-invariant we see that:
$$1728\frac{4a^3}{4a^3+27b^2}=1728\frac{2^2\cdot 3^3k^3}{2^2\cdot 3^3k^3+3^3\cdot 2^2k^2}=\frac{1728}{1+k^{-1}}=
\frac{1728}{\frac{j_0+1728-j_0}{j_0}}=j_0$$
As required.

Based on the theory of complex multiplication (which is not possible to describe here in detail), a polynomial with integer coefficients, called the \emph{Hilbert Class Polynomial}
can be found for every value of discriminant $D$, such that if $j_0$ is a root of the polynomial (over $\mathbb{Q}$), the corresponding elliptic curve
possesses complex multiplication for $D$. As we are only interested in the j-invariant modulo $p$, it suffices to find a root to the Hilber class polynomial
over $\mathbb{F}_p$ - a relatively simple and discrete process which does not involve issues of precision.

The Hilbert class polynomials are usually computed by generating their roots in $\mathbb{C}$ and multiplying accordingly. This is a costly process which
does involve precision issues. Therefore, an alternative approach is simply to rely on a large known list of the Hilbert class polynomials for small values of $D$. This
works very well in practice and does not compromise the safety of the curve (which relies on the size of $p$ and its order).

\subsubsection{Summary - Overview of The Full Method}
We now describe the exact algorithm used for generation of curves over $\mathbb{F}_p$ with a known order. There are two possible approaches, depending on one's goals.
One can start with a known $p$ and search for a suitable curve amond the known values of $D$, or one can choose $D$ upfront and choose random values of $p$. Therefore we have
two ``initialization'' algorithms:

Version 1: Known $p$.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Choose some value of $D$.
 \item Apply Cornacchia's algorithm in order to find t,s such that $t^2+|D|s^2=4p$.
 \item Check that among the two order candidates, $u_1=p+1+t,u_2=p+1-t$ there is at least one with admissible factorization. Otherwise, go back to step 1.
\end{enumerate}

Version 2: Known $D$.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Randomally choose integers $s,t$. of the appropriate magnitude.
 \item Check that $p=\frac{t^2+|D|s^2}{4}$ is a prime integer (using the Miller-Rabin primality test, for example).
 \item Check that among the two order candidates, $u_1=p+1+t,u_2=p+1-t$ there is at least one with admissible factorization. Otherwise, go back to step 1.
\end{enumerate}

The rest of the algorithm is the same no matter which initialization method was chosen:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Calculate (or find from a given list) the Hilbert class polynomial $H_D$ corresponding to $D$.
 \item Find a root $j_0$ of $H_D$ in the field $\mathbb{F}_p$.
 \item Set $k=\frac{j_0}{1728-j_0}$ modulo $p$.
 \item Set the resulting curve to be the one defined by $a=3kc^2,b=2kc^3$ for a random $c\in\mathbb{F}_p$
 \item Check which of the two possible candidates is the order of the curve. If it has an admissible factorization, return the curve; otherwise,
	  return the twist of the curve (i.e. pick randomally a non-square $e\in\mathbb{F}_p$ and return the curve $y^2=x^3+ae^2+be^3$.
\end{enumerate}
